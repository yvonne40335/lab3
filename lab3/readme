compile program for question A
  g++ -o lab3 lab3.cpp
  
compile program for question B
  make
  
result of B:
  size=1000
  sort():0 seconds
  v1 and v2 are different.
  insertion_sort():0 seconds
  v1 and v2 are the same.

  size=10000
  sort():0 seconds
  v1 and v2 are different.
  insertion_sort():1.31 seconds
  v1 and v2 are the same.

  size=100000
  sort():0.04 seconds
  v1 and v2 are different.
  insertion_sort():128.42 seconds
  v1 and v2 are the same.

  size=1000000
  sort():0.51 seconds
  v1 and v2 are different.
  insertion_sort():12814.7 seconds
  v1 and v2 are the same.
  
  sort()[nlogn]
  insertion_sort()[n^2]
  因此insertion_sort運算所需的次數會比sort還多次,時間自然也較長
